ResearchHarness is a foundational harness for running tool-using LLM agents on
real local and web tasks. It is designed to be **general**, **stable**,
**fair**, **lightweight**, and **feature-complete**.

It serves three practical roles:

1. a **fair execution substrate for agent benchmarks** such as [ResearchClawBench](https://github.com/InternScience/ResearchClawBench)
2. a **reference baseline and meta harness** for future harness optimization
3. a **lightweight personal assistant runtime** for coding, file work, and report writing

The goal is not novelty for its own sake. The goal is to provide a small,
inspectable agent harness that is easy to run, easy to compare, easy to extend,
and easy to trust as infrastructure.

## 📰 News

- **2026-05-13: Local browser frontend and conversational CLI**
  ResearchHarness now includes a one-command local chat UI for interactive agent runs. It streams assistant/tool steps in real time, runs directly inside a selected local workspace, supports image attachments, handles `AskUser` replies through the same chat input box, and lets users continue after a final answer without losing prior context. Frontend runs can be interrupted with **Stop** and resumed from the preserved context; interactive CLI runs can use `Ctrl+C` to interrupt the current run and continue chatting. CLI step output now uses compact colored boxes for assistant/tool/runtime events. API deployment remains intentionally one request -> one answer.
- **2026-05-12: OpenAI-compatible API server**
  ResearchHarness can now be deployed as a synchronous `/v1/chat/completions` service. Existing OpenAI SDK clients can send plain-text or multimodal requests, while the server creates an isolated workspace per request and uses input/output LLM wrappers to keep agent execution stable and final answers format-compliant.
- **2026-04-30: Interactive `AskUser` tool**
  ResearchHarness now includes an `AskUser` native tool for essential human clarification in interactive runs, while the ResearchClawBench adapter explicitly excludes it to keep benchmark runs non-interactive.
- **2026-04-30: Workspace roots are created automatically**
  Explicit `workspace_root` paths are now created at run startup when missing, while tool path resolution still stays bounded inside the workspace.
- **2026-04-25: Automatic context compaction for long runs**
  ResearchHarness now supports built-in context compaction for long multi-step tasks instead of relying only on a growing raw message list.
- **2026-04-25: Configurable compaction trigger**
  The default compaction trigger is `128k`, and you can override it with `AUTO_COMPACT_TRIGGER_TOKENS=16k` or `llm.generate_cfg["compact_trigger_tokens"] = "32k"`.
- **2026-04-25: Training-ready trace capture**
  The existing `trace_*.jsonl` format now records full `llm_call` and `compaction` payloads in the same file, so reasoning context, tool environment, and memory-compression steps can all be reused for training or distillation.
- **2026-04-25: Preserved compact memory**
  Compaction outputs are still written into session state, and the trace now captures the compaction request/response path as an explicit training event.

---

## ✨ Highlights

- **Native tool calling**
  The harness uses OpenAI-compatible native tool calling instead of a custom text protocol.
- **OpenAI-compatible API serving**
  ResearchHarness can be deployed behind `/v1/chat/completions`, so existing OpenAI SDK clients can call it as a tool-using agent backend.
- **General model support**
  The runtime is built around OpenAI-compatible chat-completions APIs, which makes it straightforward to use GPT, Gemini, Qwen, GLM, and other model families when exposed through that interface.
- **Fair benchmark substrate**
  The project is well-suited to benchmark evaluation because the runtime contract stays explicit, stable, and lightweight.
- **Baseline and meta harness**
  ResearchHarness can act as a reference baseline today and as the harness-under-test when you later optimize prompts, loop policies, tool behavior, or benchmark adapters.
- **Lightweight but complete**
  One main loop, a focused tool surface, readable CLI output, and flat traces cover real agent work without turning the repository into a large platform.
- **Extensible agent base**
  Upper-layer frameworks can subclass the base ReAct agent and append role-specific prompt blocks without rewriting the execution loop.
- **Workspace-first execution**
  Local paths, shell execution, and file discovery all start from one explicit workspace root.
- **Full tool surface**
  File discovery, file reads, PDF reads, image inspection, shell execution, and persistent terminal sessions are all available in one compact runtime.
- **End-to-end evaluation**
  The repo validates actual multi-step agent behavior, not just isolated tool calls.
- **PDF-to-figure workflow**
  `ReadPDF` can expose extracted image paths, and `ReadImage` can inspect the actual extracted figure file.

## 🧭 Positioning

ResearchHarness should be understood as a **base harness**: a small execution
substrate for tool-using LLM agents, not a large workflow platform.

| Area | What ResearchHarness focuses on |
| --- | --- |
| Positioning | Foundational harness, not a workflow platform |
| Models | GPT, Gemini, Qwen, GLM, and other OpenAI-compatible LLMs |
| Runtime | Small native tool-calling harness loop |
| Evaluation | Repeatable and benchmark-friendly execution |
| Extensibility | Base agent plus role-specific prompt addenda |
| Personal use | Coding, file processing, report writing, and local agent work |
| Data | Flat JSONL traces for debugging, replay, and optional training reuse |

It is a good fit when you need:

- a common and fair runtime for benchmark evaluation
- a compact baseline for harness research and optimization
- a lightweight personal agent for day-to-day work
- a readable execution loop with real tools and real artifacts
- a stable interface that is easy to debug and compare

It is intentionally **not** trying to be:

- a large workflow engine
- a multi-tenant serving platform
- a deeply abstract orchestration framework
- a kitchen-sink agent product

Instead, it keeps the core contract small and concrete:

- one main ReAct loop
- one explicit workspace root
- one readable CLI entrypoint
- one flat trace format
- one focused but capable tool surface

If you need stricter security isolation or product-specific orchestration, those
should be added as separate layers around the harness rather than folded into
the core runtime.

| Use | Why ResearchHarness fits |
| --- | --- |
| Fair benchmark base | It keeps the runtime contract explicit and lightweight, which is useful for benchmarks such as ResearchClawBench. |
| Baseline and meta harness | It is small enough to inspect and modify, making it a practical reference baseline and an object of optimization itself. |
| Personal assistant | It already includes file, shell, PDF, image, and report-oriented workflows, so it is useful outside benchmark settings too. |

## 📦 Installation and Configuration

### Install

Use any Python environment manager you prefer:

- `venv`
- `conda`
- `uv`
- system Python

Install dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configure

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in all required variables.

ResearchHarness currently talks to OpenAI-compatible chat-completions APIs. In
practice, that means GPT, Gemini, Qwen, GLM, and other model families can be
used when they are exposed through a compatible endpoint.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **🚨 Required setup before running ResearchHarness**
>
> Fill in all required environment variables before starting the agent:
> `API_KEY`, `API_BASE`, `MODEL_NAME`, `SERPER_KEY_ID`, `JINA_API_KEYS`, and `MINERU_TOKEN`.
>
> Service key sources:
> - LLM provider key and endpoint: your OpenAI-compatible provider.
> - Serper API key for `WebSearch` and `ScholarSearch`: https://serper.dev/
> - Jina API key for `WebFetch`: https://jina.ai/
> - MinerU token plus [`structai`](https://github.com/black-yt/structai) for `ReadPDF`: https://mineru.net/
>
> Before using ResearchHarness for real tasks, run the full tool availability check and require every tool to pass:
>
> ```bash
> python3 tests/test_tool_availability.py
> ```
>
> The expected result is all tools passing. Missing credentials, missing dependencies, exhausted service credits, or unavailable external tools should be treated as failures, not skipped checks.
> If `WebSearch`, `ScholarSearch`, `WebFetch`, or `ReadPDF` fails with network, TLS, upload, download, or parsing errors, retry with VPN/proxy disabled.

Required variables:

- `API_KEY`
- `API_BASE`
- `MODEL_NAME`
- `SERPER_KEY_ID`
- `JINA_API_KEYS`
- `MINERU_TOKEN`

Optional variables:

- `WORKSPACE_ROOT`
- `MAX_LLM_CALL_PER_RUN`
- `MAX_AGENT_ROUNDS`
- `MAX_AGENT_RUNTIME_SECONDS`
- `LLM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`
- `LLM_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS`
- `MAX_INPUT_TOKENS`
- `LLM_MAX_RETRIES`
- `TEMPERATURE`
- `TOP_P`
- `PRESENCE_PENALTY`
- `AUTO_COMPACT_TRIGGER_TOKENS`
- `IMAGE_PART_TOKEN_ESTIMATE`
- `LLM_IMAGE_MAX_EDGE`
- `LLM_IMAGE_MAX_BYTES`
- `LLM_IMAGE_JPEG_QUALITY`
- `DEBUG_AGENT`
- `DEBUG_SEARCH`
- `DEBUG_SCHOLAR`
- `DEBUG_VISIT`

Minimal example:

```env
API_KEY="your_api_key"
API_BASE="https://your-openai-compatible-endpoint/v1"
MODEL_NAME="gpt-5.4"
SERPER_KEY_ID="your_serper_key"
JINA_API_KEYS="your_jina_key"
MINERU_TOKEN="your_mineru_token"
```

Sampling defaults and retry policy live in code. Override them programmatically
when needed instead of storing them in `.env`.

### Configuration Precedence

ResearchHarness uses explicit runtime arguments before ambient defaults:

```text
command-line arguments > process environment variables > .env > code defaults
```

Details:

- If a setting exists both as a command-line argument and an environment-level
  default, the command-line argument wins for that run. For example,
  `--workspace-root` overrides `WORKSPACE_ROOT`.
- Process environment variables already exported in the shell are not
  overwritten by `.env`.
- `.env` fills missing environment variables only; it is a convenient local
  default file, not a higher-priority override layer.
- `--trace-dir` has no environment-variable equivalent. Trace/session state is
  written only when this argument is supplied in direct CLI runs.
- `--api-runs-dir` is required for the OpenAI-compatible API server and is not
  inferred from `WORKSPACE_ROOT`.
- In frontend mode, the workspace is selected in the browser, but other
  meaningful agent options remain command-line options. Use
  `--role-prompt-file` to append role guidance and `--trace-dir` to persist
  frontend agent traces.
- In CLI mode, interactive terminals enable follow-up chat by default. Use
  `--no-chat` for one-shot behavior or `--chat` to force follow-up mode.
- Model and sampling settings such as `API_KEY`, `API_BASE`, `MODEL_NAME`,
  `TEMPERATURE`, `MAX_INPUT_TOKENS`, and `LLM_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` currently come
  from environment variables or `.env`, not from direct CLI flags.

### Extending the Base Agent

The harness keeps the base system prompt focused on tool calling, local
execution, and the ReAct loop. Domain-specific frameworks should extend the
agent class and append role-specific prompt blocks instead of replacing the base
prompt.

Inspect the base prompt assets:

```bash
python3 -m agent_base.prompt --list-assets
python3 -m agent_base.prompt --show-system
```

---

## 🖥 CLI Usage

Run the agent from your terminal through the thin top-level entrypoint:

```bash
python3 run_agent.py "Who proposed the transformer architecture, and in what year was the paper published?"
```

The original module entrypoint also remains available:

```bash
python3 -m agent_base.react_agent "Who proposed the transformer architecture, and in what year was the paper published?"
```

Save a trace:

```bash
python3 -m agent_base.react_agent "your prompt" --trace-dir ./traces
```

When a trace directory is provided, ResearchHarness creates a file named like
`trace_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_<runid>.jsonl` inside that directory.
You can replace `./traces` with any other trace directory.
Without `--trace-dir`, CLI runs do not write a trace file or `_session_state.json`.

Use an explicit workspace:

```bash
python3 -m agent_base.react_agent "summarize this project" --workspace-root ./workspace
```

You can replace `./workspace` with any other workspace directory. CLI mode uses
`--workspace-root` directly as the agent-visible workspace; it does not create
per-run `agent_workspace/` or `agent_trace/` subdirectories inside it.

Run with one extra role-prompt file appended to the base prompt:

```bash
python3 -m agent_base.react_agent "review this artifact" \
  --workspace-root ./workspace \
  --role-prompt-file /path/to/role_prompt.md
```

Attach one or more local images to the initial user message:

```bash
python3 run_agent.py "Read the image and answer in JSON." \
  --workspace-root ./workspace \
  --images /path/to/image.png /path/to/second-image.png
```

Each `--images` path must exist. ResearchHarness copies every image into
`./workspace/inputs/images/`, sends each one as a standard `image_url` content
part, and includes each saved relative path in the user text so later rounds can
recover images with `ReadImage`.

In an interactive terminal, the CLI stays open after the final answer and asks
for a follow-up prompt. The next run keeps the previous message history,
including tool results and saved image path hints, so the agent can continue the
same conversation. During a running step, `Ctrl+C` interrupts the current run at
the next safe point and returns to follow-up mode with context preserved. Press
`Ctrl+C` at the follow-up prompt or send EOF to exit. Use `--no-chat` when a
script or benchmark needs strict one-shot behavior.

The CLI is not limited to a final one-line answer. During execution it prints a
readable step-by-step stream so you can inspect what the agent is doing without
opening trace files:

- model name
- workspace root
- prompt
- per-round assistant output
- tool calls
- tool results
- runtime correction messages when a turn is invalid

This makes direct harness runs readable without requiring debug-only logs.

---

## 🎛 Local Frontend UI

For interactive local use, run the browser UI instead of the OpenAI-compatible
API server:

```bash
python3 run_frontend.py
```

The launcher binds to `127.0.0.1:8765` and opens the browser automatically. To
choose a different port or keep the browser closed:

```bash
python3 run_frontend.py --port 8766 --no-browser
```

Useful agent options are also available in frontend mode:

```bash
python3 run_frontend.py \
  --trace-dir ./traces \
  --role-prompt-file benchmarks/QA/role_prompt.md
```

The frontend keeps only the current conversation in the page. It runs the agent
directly in the selected existing workspace folder, streams assistant rounds and
tool results over WebSocket, supports `AskUser` replies through the same chat
input box, and accepts image attachments by file picker, drag-and-drop, or paste.
After a run finishes, typing another message continues the same conversation
with prior messages preserved. Click **New chat** to clear the current
conversation and start over. During a running step, the send button becomes
**Stop**; stopping is cooperative and preserves context for the next message
once the current model or tool call reaches a safe stop point.

The workspace picker is an in-page directory browser backed by the local server,
not a native OS dialog. It supports Unicode paths, including Chinese folder
names, and you can still paste a folder path manually when that is faster.

Attached images are sent to the model as OpenAI-style `image_url` content parts.
They are also saved under `inputs/images/` inside the selected workspace. The
saved relative path is included as text next to the image input, so later model
steps can refer back to the file and call `ReadImage` if visual inspection is
needed again.

---

## 🚀 OpenAI-Compatible API Deployment

ResearchHarness can run as a synchronous OpenAI-compatible agent service for
benchmarks, local applications, automation scripts, and personal assistant
workflows. Existing clients only need to point the OpenAI SDK `base_url` at the
ResearchHarness server; behind that familiar interface, RH still runs its full
tool-using agent loop.

The server exposes:

```http
POST /v1/chat/completions
```

API deployment is intentionally stateless at the conversation level: each HTTP
request creates one isolated run and returns one final assistant message. If a
client wants multi-turn API behavior, it should send the desired prior context
in the request messages or manage that state outside ResearchHarness.

Start the server in one terminal. `--api-runs-dir` is a parent directory used
only for API runs; each request gets its own isolated subdirectory under it, so
separate users, scripts, and benchmark cases do not share files.

Each request creates:

```text
./api_runs/
└── run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_<random>/
    ├── agent_workspace/          # visible to the agent
    │   └── inputs/
    │       └── images/           # user-provided images, when present
    └── agent_trace/              # server-side trace and session state
        ├── api_trace.jsonl
        ├── trace_*.jsonl
        └── _session_state.json
```

In deployment mode, traces are saved by default. Each request writes API wrapper
events, agent trace, and session state into that run's `agent_trace/` directory.

Default deployment for normal application or personal-assistant use:

```bash
python3 run_server.py \
  --api-runs-dir ./api_runs \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 8686
```

QA/VQA benchmark deployment with the optional benchmark role overlay:

```bash
python3 run_server.py \
  --api-runs-dir ./api_runs \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 8686 \
  --role-prompt-file benchmarks/QA/role_prompt.md
```

### Wrapper Modes

The API server has two optional LLM wrapper passes. Both are enabled by default.

- `--input-wrapper` / `--no-input-wrapper`: enable or disable the LLM pass that rewrites user input into a stable agent task.
- `--output-wrapper` / `--no-output-wrapper`: enable or disable the LLM pass that formats the agent result to the requested answer contract.

Strict-format benchmark mode usually keeps both wrappers on:

```bash
python3 run_server.py \
  --api-runs-dir ./api_runs \
  --role-prompt-file benchmarks/QA/role_prompt.md \
  --input-wrapper \
  --output-wrapper
```

Direct agent mode disables both wrappers and returns the agent's own final text:

```bash
python3 run_server.py \
  --api-runs-dir ./api_runs \
  --no-input-wrapper \
  --no-output-wrapper
```

If the input is simple but the answer still needs strict final formatting, keep
only the output wrapper:

```bash
python3 run_server.py \
  --api-runs-dir ./api_runs \
  --no-input-wrapper \
  --output-wrapper
```

### Text Request

Use the normal OpenAI SDK from another terminal, application, or benchmark
runner:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(api_key="unused", base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8686/v1")

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="researchharness",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Answer the question in one sentence: what is 2 + 2?"}
    ],
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Multimodal Request

Multimodal requests use OpenAI-style content parts. The first API version
supports one or more `data:image/...;base64,...` image URLs in the same request.

```python
import base64
from io import BytesIO

from PIL import Image, ImageDraw
from openai import OpenAI

image = Image.new("RGB", (320, 120), "white")
draw = ImageDraw.Draw(image)
draw.text((40, 45), "7 + 5 = ?", fill="black")
buffer = BytesIO()
image.save(buffer, format="PNG")
data_url = "data:image/png;base64," + base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode("ascii")

client = OpenAI(api_key="unused", base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8686/v1")

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="researchharness",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": (
                        "The image contains a simple arithmetic expression. "
                        "Return JSON with exactly two keys: expression and answer."
                    ),
                },
                {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": data_url}},
            ],
        }
    ],
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

For multimodal API requests, each image content part is passed directly to the
backend model when the selected model supports image parts. Each image is also
saved under `agent_workspace/inputs/images/`, and each saved relative path is
included in the agent-visible text next to the corresponding image content part.
If an image is needed again after later turns, the agent can call `ReadImage` on
the saved path instead of relying on repeated inline image bytes.

### API Execution Flow

API execution uses three stages:

- Input wrapper: separates the task from strict output-format instructions.
- ResearchHarness agent: solves the task with tools and an isolated workspace.
- Output wrapper: formats the agent result to match the user's requested answer contract.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    U[User Input] --> IW[Input Wrapper LLM]
    IW --> A[ResearchHarness Agent]
    A --> OW[Output Wrapper LLM]
    OW --> O[Output]
```

This keeps the public interface simple for callers while letting ResearchHarness
handle real tool work internally. It is useful both for strict QA/VQA benchmark
formats and for ordinary users who want a local agent service that can write
files, inspect images, run tools, and return one clean final answer.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

ResearchHarness follows a deliberately simple harness loop so that execution
stays readable and benchmark behavior stays comparable:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Request] --> B[Build Messages]
    B --> C[Call LLM with Native Tool Schemas]
    C --> D{Tool Calls?}
    D -- Yes --> E[Execute Tools]
    E --> F[Append Tool Results]
    F --> C
    D -- No --> G[Return Final Text]
```

The public harness API stays intentionally small:

```python
result_text = agent.run(prompt, workspace_root=None)
```

Properties:

- `prompt`: the prompt string
- `workspace_root`: optional workspace root
- return value: exactly one final text string

Model config, retry policy, trace directory, and runtime controls are
initialization-time settings, not `run(...)` arguments.

### Workspace Basics

The harness uses a single workspace concept in direct agent runs.

- `WORKSPACE_ROOT` defines the default workspace root when you want an environment-level default
- `run(..., workspace_root=...)` overrides it for that run and creates the directory if it does not exist
- relative local file paths resolve from the workspace
- `Bash` and `TerminalStart` start from the workspace by default

The repository includes committed [workspace/.gitkeep](workspace/.gitkeep),
[api_runs/.gitkeep](api_runs/.gitkeep), and [traces/.gitkeep](traces/.gitkeep)
files so these runtime roots exist in Git, while artifacts inside them remain
ignored.

### Execution Records and Long Runs

A trace is the chronological record of what happened during a run. It is useful
when you need to debug behavior, compare benchmark runs, replay a trajectory, or
collect data for later analysis.

ResearchHarness writes traces as a flat JSONL event stream.

Every row uses the same keys:

- `run_id`
- `event_index`
- `turn_index`
- `timestamp`
- `model_name`
- `workspace_root`
- `role`
- `text`
- `tool_call_ids`
- `tool_names`
- `tool_arguments`
- `finish_reason`
- `termination`
- `error`
- `image_paths`
- `capture_type`
- `payload`

The trace includes:

- system prompt
- prompt
- assistant tool-call turns
- tool results
- runtime-injected messages
- final assistant text

When tracing is enabled, `_session_state.json` is written next to the trace file.
Without `--trace-dir`, CLI runs do not write either file. API deployment mode
always writes trace records under each run's `agent_trace/` directory.

Why flat traces?

- easier to replay
- easier to diff
- easier to inspect during evaluation and debugging
- no secondary export format required

Training-oriented capture is stored in the same JSONL stream:

- `capture_type = "llm_call"`
  stores the exact request messages sent to the model and the structured model response
- `capture_type = "compaction"`
  stores the pre-compaction messages, summary request, summary response, resulting compact memory, and post-compaction message state

This keeps the trace filename and flat JSONL contract unchanged while making the
same file usable for debugging, replay, benchmark inspection, and optional
step-level training or distillation.

Long runs can trigger automatic context compaction before the input budget is
exhausted. By default, the trigger budget is `128k`. You can override it when
you want earlier or later compaction:

```bash
AUTO_COMPACT_TRIGGER_TOKENS=16k python3 run_agent.py "your prompt"
```

or programmatically:

```python
llm = {
    "model": "gpt-5.4",
    "generate_cfg": {
        "compact_trigger_tokens": "32k",
    },
}
```

### PDF and Image Handling

`ReadPDF` is designed for PDF structure and extracted content. It returns:

- extracted text
- extracted local image paths when the parser provides them

Recommended PDF-figure workflow:

1. use `ReadPDF`
2. inspect the returned `image_paths`
3. pass the selected image path to `ReadImage`

`ReadImage` returns image metadata and, during the main agent run, attaches a
compressed image as a standard `image_url` content part for the model request.
This is the standard OpenAI-compatible multimodal request shape used by this
repository for local images.

## 🧪 Testing

The harness includes both tool-level checks and end-to-end agent tests.

Test scripts default to the current interpreter. If you want child processes to
use a specific interpreter, set:

```bash
RESEARCHHARNESS_TEST_PYTHON="/path/to/your/python"
```

| Test | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Tool availability | `python3 tests/test_tool_availability.py --json` |
| Local tool validation | `python3 tests/test_local_tools_validation.py` |
| Direct toolchain validation | `python3 tests/test_toolchain_validation.py` |
| OpenAI-compatible API checks | `python3 tests/test_openai_api_checks.py` |
| Local frontend checks | `python3 tests/test_frontend_checks.py` |

## ⚠️ Boundaries and License

- This repository is a harness runtime, not a security product
- `ReadPDF` depends on [`structai`](https://github.com/black-yt/structai) and `MINERU_TOKEN`
- `ReadImage` currently sends compressed local images as inline `data:` URLs through standard `image_url` request parts
- The runtime currently expects an OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint
- Real LLM behavior is still the least deterministic part of the system, even with native tool calling and test coverage

ResearchHarness is released under the [MIT License](LICENSE). Runtime artifacts
created under `workspace/`, `api_runs/`, and `traces/` are local execution
outputs and are ignored by Git except for their `.gitkeep` placeholders.
