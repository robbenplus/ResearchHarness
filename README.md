ResearchHarness is a foundational harness for running tool-using LLM agents on real local and web tasks. It is designed to be **general**, **stable**, **fair**, **lightweight**, and **feature-complete**.

It serves three practical roles:

1. a **fair execution substrate for agent benchmarks** such as [ResearchClawBench](https://github.com/InternScience/ResearchClawBench)
2. a **reference baseline and meta harness** for future harness optimization
3. a **lightweight personal assistant runtime** for coding, file work, and report writing

The goal is not novelty for its own sake. The goal is to provide a small, inspectable agent harness that is easy to run, easy to compare, easy to extend, and easy to trust as infrastructure.

## ✨ Highlights

- **Native tool calling**
  The harness uses OpenAI-compatible native tool calling instead of a custom text protocol.
- **General model support**
  The runtime is built around OpenAI-compatible chat-completions APIs, which makes it straightforward to use GPT, Gemini, Qwen, GLM, and other model families when exposed through that interface.
- **Fair benchmark substrate**
  The project is well-suited to benchmark evaluation because the runtime contract stays explicit, stable, and lightweight.
- **Baseline and meta harness**
  ResearchHarness can act as a reference baseline today and as the harness-under-test when you later optimize prompts, loop policies, tool behavior, or benchmark adapters.
- **Lightweight but complete**
  One main loop, a focused tool surface, readable CLI output, and flat traces cover real agent work without turning the repository into a large platform.
- **Extensible agent base**
  Upper-layer frameworks can subclass the base ReAct agent and append role-specific prompt blocks without rewriting the execution loop.
- **Workspace-first execution**
  Local paths, shell execution, and file discovery all start from one explicit workspace root.
- **Full tool surface**
  File discovery, file reads, PDF reads, image inspection, shell execution, and persistent terminal sessions are all available in one compact runtime.
- **End-to-end evaluation**
  The repo validates actual multi-step agent behavior, not just isolated tool calls.
- **PDF-to-figure workflow**
  `ReadPDF` can expose extracted image paths, and `ReadImage` can inspect the actual extracted figure file.

## 📰 News

- **2026-04-25: Automatic context compaction for long runs**
  ResearchHarness now supports built-in context compaction for long multi-step tasks instead of relying only on a growing raw message list.
- **2026-04-25: Configurable compaction trigger**
  You can override the automatic trigger budget with `AUTO_COMPACT_TRIGGER_TOKENS=16k` or `llm.generate_cfg["compact_trigger_tokens"] = "32k"`.
- **2026-04-25: Training-ready trace capture**
  The existing `trace_*.jsonl` format now records full `llm_call` and `compaction` payloads in the same file, so reasoning context, tool environment, and memory-compression steps can all be reused for training or distillation.
- **2026-04-25: Preserved compact memory**
  Compaction outputs are still written into session state, and the trace now captures the compaction request/response path as an explicit training event.

### At a Glance

| Area | What ResearchHarness focuses on |
| --- | --- |
| Positioning | Foundational harness, not a workflow platform |
| Models | GPT, Gemini, Qwen, GLM, and other OpenAI-compatible LLMs |
| Runtime | Small native tool-calling harness loop |
| Evaluation | Repeatable and benchmark-friendly execution |
| Extensibility | Base agent plus role-specific prompt addenda |
| Personal use | Coding, file processing, report writing, and local agent work |
| Data | Flat JSONL traces for debugging, replay, and optional training reuse |

---

## 🧭 Positioning

ResearchHarness should be understood as a **base harness**.

It is a good fit when you need:

- a common and fair runtime for benchmark evaluation
- a compact baseline for harness research and optimization
- a lightweight personal agent for day-to-day work
- a readable execution loop with real tools and real artifacts
- a stable interface that is easy to debug and compare

It is intentionally **not** trying to be:

- a large workflow engine
- a multi-tenant serving platform
- a deeply abstract orchestration framework
- a kitchen-sink agent product

Instead, it keeps the core contract small and concrete:

- one main ReAct loop
- one explicit workspace root
- one readable CLI entrypoint
- one flat trace format
- one focused but capable tool surface

If you need stricter security isolation or product-specific orchestration, those should be added as separate layers around the harness rather than folded into the core runtime.

### Three Common Uses

| Use | Why ResearchHarness fits |
| --- | --- |
| Fair benchmark base | It keeps the runtime contract explicit and lightweight, which is useful for benchmarks such as ResearchClawBench. |
| Baseline and meta harness | It is small enough to inspect and modify, making it a practical reference baseline and an object of optimization itself. |
| Personal assistant | It already includes file, shell, PDF, image, and report-oriented workflows, so it is useful outside benchmark settings too. |

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Install

Use any Python environment manager you prefer:

- `venv`
- `conda`
- `uv`
- system Python

Install dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the keys you need.

ResearchHarness currently talks to OpenAI-compatible chat-completions APIs. In practice, that means GPT, Gemini, Qwen, GLM, and other model families can be used when they are exposed through a compatible endpoint.

Important variables:

- `API_KEY`
- `API_BASE`
- `MODEL_NAME`
- `SUMMARY_MODEL_NAME`
- `SERPER_KEY_ID`
- `JINA_API_KEYS`
- `MINERU_TOKEN`

Minimal example:

```env
API_KEY=your_api_key
API_BASE=https://your-openai-compatible-endpoint/v1
MODEL_NAME=gpt-5.4
# SUMMARY_MODEL_NAME=gpt-5.4
```

Sampling defaults, retry policy, and runtime limits live in code. Override them programmatically when needed instead of storing them in `.env`.

Capability-specific requirements:

- `WebSearch` / `ScholarSearch` require `SERPER_KEY_ID`
- `WebFetch` requires `JINA_API_KEYS`
- `ReadPDF` requires `MINERU_TOKEN` and `structai`

### 2.5 Extending the Base Agent

The harness keeps the base system prompt focused on tool calling, local execution, and the ReAct loop. Domain-specific frameworks should extend the agent class and append role-specific prompt blocks instead of replacing the base prompt.

Inspect the base prompt assets:

```bash
python3 -m agent_base.prompt --list-assets
python3 -m agent_base.prompt --show-system
```

### 3. Run

Run the agent directly through the thin top-level entrypoint:

```bash
python3 run_agent.py "Who proposed the transformer architecture, and in what year was the paper published?"
```

The original module entrypoint also remains available:

```bash
python3 -m agent_base.react_agent "Who proposed the transformer architecture, and in what year was the paper published?"
```

Save a trace:

```bash
python3 -m agent_base.react_agent "your prompt" --trace-dir workspace/manual_runs
```

When a trace directory is provided, ResearchHarness creates a file named like
`trace_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_<runid>.jsonl` inside that directory.

Use an explicit workspace:

```bash
python3 -m agent_base.react_agent "summarize this project" --workspace-root /path/to/workspace
```

Run with one extra role-prompt file appended to the base prompt:

```bash
python3 -m agent_base.react_agent "review this artifact" \
  --workspace-root /path/to/workspace \
  --role-prompt-file /path/to/role_prompt.md
```

---

## 🧠 How It Works

ResearchHarness follows a deliberately simple harness loop so that execution stays readable and benchmark behavior stays comparable:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Request] --> B[Build Messages]
    B --> C[Call LLM with Native Tool Schemas]
    C --> D{Tool Calls?}
    D -- Yes --> E[Execute Tools]
    E --> F[Append Tool Results]
    F --> C
    D -- No --> G[Return Final Text]
```

The public harness API stays intentionally small:

```python
result_text = agent.run(prompt, workspace_root=None)
```

Properties:

- `prompt`: the prompt string
- `workspace_root`: optional workspace root
- return value: exactly one final text string

Model config, retry policy, trace directory, and runtime controls are initialization-time settings, not `run(...)` arguments.

### 🖥 CLI Output

The CLI is not limited to a final one-line answer.

During execution it prints:

- model name
- workspace root
- prompt
- per-round assistant output
- tool calls
- tool results
- runtime correction messages when a turn is invalid

This makes direct harness runs readable without requiring debug-only logs.

```

---

## 🗂 Workspace Model

The harness uses a single workspace concept.

- `WORKSPACE_ROOT` defines the default workspace root when you want an environment-level default
- `run(..., workspace_root=...)` overrides it for that run
- relative local file paths resolve from the workspace
- `Bash` and `TerminalStart` start from the workspace by default

The repository includes a committed [workspace/.gitkeep](workspace/.gitkeep) so the directory exists in Git, while runtime artifacts inside `workspace/` remain ignored.

---

## 🖼 PDF and Image Flow

### `ReadPDF`

`ReadPDF` is designed for PDF structure and extracted content. It returns:

- extracted text
- extracted local image paths when the parser provides them

Recommended PDF-figure workflow:

1. use `ReadPDF`
2. inspect the returned `image_paths`
3. pass the selected image path to `ReadImage`

### `ReadImage`

`ReadImage` returns image metadata and, during the main agent run, attaches a compressed image as a standard `image_url` content part for the model request.

This is the standard OpenAI-compatible multimodal request shape used by this repository for local images.

---

## 🧾 Trace Format

Traces are written as a flat JSONL event stream.

Every row uses the same keys:

- `run_id`
- `event_index`
- `turn_index`
- `timestamp`
- `model_name`
- `workspace_root`
- `role`
- `text`
- `tool_call_ids`
- `tool_names`
- `tool_arguments`
- `finish_reason`
- `termination`
- `error`
- `image_paths`
- `capture_type`
- `payload`

### Why flat traces?

- easier to replay
- easier to diff
- easier to inspect during evaluation and debugging
- no secondary export format required

The trace includes:

- system prompt
- prompt
- assistant tool-call turns
- tool results
- runtime-injected messages
- final assistant text

It also now supports training-oriented captures in the same file:

- `capture_type = "llm_call"`
  stores the exact request messages sent to the model and the structured model response
- `capture_type = "compaction"`
  stores the pre-compaction messages, summary request, summary response, resulting compact memory, and post-compaction message state

This keeps the trace filename and flat JSONL contract unchanged while making the same file usable for:

- debugging
- replay
- benchmark inspection
- step-level training and distillation

In practice, this means the harness can be used not only to run agents, but also to archive real tool-using trajectories for later analysis or optional training reuse.

### Auto Compaction

Long runs can trigger automatic context compaction before the input budget is exhausted.

By default, the trigger budget is computed from the model input/output budget. You can override it when you want earlier compaction:

```bash
AUTO_COMPACT_TRIGGER_TOKENS=16k python3 run_agent.py "your prompt"
```

or programmatically:

```python
llm = {
    "model": "gpt-5.4",
    "generate_cfg": {
        "compact_trigger_tokens": "32k",
    },
}
```

## ⚠️ Known Boundaries

- This repository is a harness runtime, not a security product
- `ReadPDF` depends on `structai` and `MINERU_TOKEN`
- `ReadImage` currently sends compressed local images as inline `data:` URLs through standard `image_url` request parts
- The runtime currently expects an OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint
- Real LLM behavior is still the least deterministic part of the system, even with native tool calling and test coverage
